Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm/style that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code 
using classes, which are used to create individual instances.

The main aim of OOP is to bind the data and the functions together
so that no other part of the code can access that data except that function (wrapped with data).
