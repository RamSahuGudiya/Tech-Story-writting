A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
It enables real-time,event-driven communication between a client and a server.

Unlike traditional HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets allow bi-directional communication.
This means that the client and the server can send data to each other anytime without continuous polling.
